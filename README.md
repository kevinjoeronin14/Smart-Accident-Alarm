# Smart-Accident-Alarm


 Arduino is the heart of the system which helps in
transferring the message to different devices in the system.
Vibration sensor will be activated when the accident occurs
and the information is transferred to the registered number
through GSM module. Using GPS the location can be sent
through tracking system to cover the geographical
coordinates over the area. The accident can be detected by a
vibration sensor which is used as major module in the
system.
